		<h1>HttpTest Instructions</h1>
		HttpTest is a program to help establish communications between two sites using HTTP.
		The sequence of instructions below is designed to find the simplest way to connect.
		</p>
		<h3>Try a straight HTTP connection without a proxy</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Click the Proxy tab. <u>Un</u>check the Use Proxy Server box.</li>
			<li>Click the HTTP Client tab. Enter a URL (e.g. "http://mirc.rsna.org") in the URL field. Select the "GET" radio button and then click Connect.</li>
			<li>If you get a connection, then you can access the internet without a proxy.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Try an HTTP connection with a proxy and no proxy authentication</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Click the Proxy tab. Check the Use Proxy Server box and enter the IP address and port of the proxy server. Clear the Username and Password fields.
			</li>
			<li>Click the HTTP Client tab. Enter a url (e.g. "http://mirc.rsna.org") in the URL field. Select the "GET" radio button and then click Connect.
			</li>
			<li>If you get a connection, then you can access the internet through the proxy without authentication.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Try an HTTP connection with a proxy and authentication</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Click the Proxy tab. Check the Use Proxy Server box and enter the IP address and port of the proxy server. Enter the authentication parameters required by the proxy server in the Username and Password fields.
			</li>
			<li>Click the HTTP Client tab. Enter a URL (e.g. "http://mirc.rsna.org") in the URL field. Select the "GET" radio button and then click Connect.
			</li>
			<li>If you get a connection, then you can access the internet through the proxy with authentication.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Try an HTTPS connection</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Once you can connect to the internet, test that you can make an HTTPS connection.
			</li>
			<li>Click the Proxy tab. Set the checkbox and entry fields for the connection method above that worked.
			</li>Click the HTTP Client tab. Enter the URL of a site that supports HTTPS (starting with <b>https://</b>) in the URL field. (Note that sites support HTTP and HTTPS on different ports. HTTP ports are typically 80 or 8080. HTTPS ports are typically 443 or 8443.) Select the "GET" radio button and then click Connect.
			</li>
			<li>If you get a connection, then you can access SSL sites on the internet.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Authentication</h3>
		The Authentication tab allows you to specify an authentication header for HTTP and HTTPS connections. Use this tab if the site you are trying to access requires authentication. These parameters are for authentication at the destination site, not the proxy server. Set the proxy server authentication parameters, if required, in the Proxy tab.
		<h3>HTTP Server</h3>
		The HTTP Server tab provides a web server that displays the contents of any connection requests it receives. It can be used when testing an HTTP client to see what headers and content it is sending. To start the server, click the Start button. The Send text response message checkbox determines whether the server responds to connections. The state of the checkbox must be set before the server is started. If the box is checked, the server returns a page in plain text listing the headers and contents it received; otherwise, it returns nothing.
		<h3>SysProps</h3>
		The SysProps tab shows the complete list of system properties accessible to Java. The key properties to check are:
			<ul>
				<li>proxySet</li>
				<li>http.proxyHost</li>
				<li>http.proxyPort</li>
			</ul>
		These parameters are used by the HTTP connection software to determine whether to use a proxy in establishing a connection.
		<p>
		The system properties do not store the authentication parameters for the proxy server. If the Username and Password fields on the Proxy tab are not blank, the authentication parameters are set by the application program in the Proxy-Authorization header in the HTTP connection request.
